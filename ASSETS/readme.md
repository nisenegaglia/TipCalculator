### What I learned

I definitely learned how distribute/use divs in a clever way, leting my work easy lately. I got another perspective in the project struture, using sections.


See below:

-html
<section class="input-outbox"> 
                    <div class="input-thirth">
                    <form id="people-number">
                        <label class="form-text">Number of People</label>
                        <div class="input-container">
                            <input class="people" type="number" min="1" name="amount" id="people">
                        </div>
                    </form>
                    </div>
                </section>

### Continued development

I want keep improving my Js knowledges for the next projects for sure. Discovering all the Js potential when i dominate it.
